Jambo Smith,
Am quite exited also to touch base with you again after the time we met at Toronto, spidina (hope I got it “techie”. Congratulation for the award for the queen, for sure you deserve it for your tireless afforts and commitment towards charitable work.  
Since we last met plenty has happened in my life and with my charity- Connecting Countries Adopt-a-School (CCAAS). I will try to touch on the highlights and also try not to bore you at the same time.
