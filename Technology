My love for technology had been obscured by the university system that had a way of avoiding what is interesting but now I had an opportunity to be me.

However I did not realize that the journey to make myself a software engineer would cost me I great deal of mind power and shorter nights as I had to study a new computer language whose name was already intimidating “Python”
